# Dunnit!
## Yeah, another iOS to-do list app.

I created this as a learning exercise whilst getting to grips with Test-Driven Development with Swift in XCode. I wanted to create a simple app from the outside in, starting with feature tests then creating unit tests as and when required.

## Features

Current features:

- Add to-do items
- Delete to-do items

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/acodeguy/Dunnit.git```
2. Open it in Xcode
3. Run the tests: ```Cmd+U```
4. Run the project in the simulator: ```Cmd+R```

## Tests
This project has both UI and unit tests, found in the usual test folders. I've written this using TDD to drive development of only the absolutely essential code to make it work.

### Installation/Dependencies

At the moment, this project has no third-party depdencies. This may change if I decide to really pimp it out with some Cocoapods for networking, storage, etc.

## License

Use it, abuse. But don't sell it.
